Support for art college students is our mission. Through our platform, painting majors create original artworks while supporters contribute either $1000 annually or $100 monthly. The original works are securely stored by us, and high-quality reproductions are provided to supporters during their contribution period. 

## Supporting Creativity and Talent

Our platform ensures that 80% of the contributions go directly to the art students, providing them with fair compensation for their hard work. The remaining portion supports the operations of the platform. Throughout the support period, students remain anonymous, allowing them to focus on their artistic endeavors.

By joining us, you make a meaningful impact on the lives of aspiring artists. Your support helps them turn their creative visions into reality.

## How It Works

- **Step 1**: Sign up to create an account on our platform and start your journey of supporting art students.
- **Step 2**: Choose your level of financial support, whether itâ€™s monthly or annually.
- **Step 3**: Enjoy high-quality reproductions of the artworks during your support period and connect with the artists.
